### Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning is conducted at the beginning of the sprint. The Product Owner presents the product backlog, the development team selects items to work on, and a sprint goal is agreed upon. The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting.

### Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a short 15-minute meeting held each day. Team members share progress, planned work, and any challenges. The Scrum Master ensures the meeting is productive and time-boxed.

### Sprint Review
At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed features of the cloud-based task management application. Feedback is collected from stakeholders to improve future work.
