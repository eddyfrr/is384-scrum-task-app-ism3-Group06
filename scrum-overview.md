## 2. Scrum Events

### Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning is conducted at the beginning of the sprint. The Product Owner presents the product backlog, the development team selects items to work on, and a sprint goal is agreed upon. The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting.

### Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a short 15-minute meeting held each day. Team members share progress, planned work, and any challenges. The Scrum Master ensures the meeting is productive and time-boxed.

### Sprint Review
At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed features of the cloud-based task management application. Feedback is collected from stakeholders to improve future work.

### Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective allows the team to reflect on the sprint process. The Scrum Master leads discussions on what went well, what needs improvement, and actions for the next sprint.

The Product Owner is responsible for maintaining and updating the backlog.

### Sprint Backlog
