## 2. Scrum Events

### Sprint Planning
Sprint Planning is conducted at the beginning of the sprint. The Product Owner presents the product backlog, the development team selects items to work on, and a sprint goal is agreed upon. The Scrum Master facilitates the meeting.

### Daily Scrum
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed meeting held each day of the sprint. Team members share their progress, planned tasks, and any challenges or blockers. The Scrum Master ensures the meeting remains focused and productive, while the Development Team uses it to coordinate work.

### Sprint Review
At the end of the sprint, the team demonstrates the completed features of the cloud-based task management application. Feedback is collected from stakeholders to improve future work.

### Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective is held after the Sprint Review. The Scrum Master leads the team in reflecting on the sprint by discussing what went well, what needs improvement, and identifying actionable steps to enhance performance in the next sprint.




## 3. Scrum Artifacts

### Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all features and requirements for the cloud-based task management application. It is maintained and prioritized by the Product Owner.

The Product Backlog includes the following functional requirements:
- Create task
- Assign task to user
- View task list
- Mark task as complete
- Send notifications

 Non-Functional Requirements :

- The system should be web-based and accessible via a browser

- The system should be secure with authentication and authorization

- The system should be easy to use and user-friendly

- The system should store data securely in the cloud

- The system should support multiple users simultaneously

The Product Owner is responsible for continuously refining, updating, and prioritizing the Product Backlog based on project needs and stakeholder feedback.

### Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog contains selected product backlog items that the development team commits to completing during the sprint.


### Increment
A working cloud-based task management web app including task creation, assignment, viewing, and completion features.

The system allows users to assign tasks to other users and mark tasks as complete when finished.
The application supports task creation, task assignment, task viewing, and task completion tracking.
Task assignment allows users to assign tasks to specific users to ensure accountability and clear ownership of work.
Task completion tracking enables users to mark tasks as completed, allowing progress monitoring throughout the sprint.
